description: SASS and styling conventions for the PESAL stack.
globs: ['assets/css/**/*.scss', 'assets/css/**/*.sass']

- Do NOT use Tailwind.
- Use modular SASS files in `assets/css/`.
- Organize SASS by views and components (e.g., `assets/css/views/_search_live.scss`).
- Use BEM naming convention for CSS classes to avoid leakage.
- Ensure the SASS watcher is configured in `dev.exs`.
